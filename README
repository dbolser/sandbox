I'm trying to 'patch' an assembly using 454 reads.

The reads were mapped to the assembly using gsMapper, and the result
was an ace file describing the positions of the reads.

The ace file was processed inot a tab delimited file using the
ace2tab.plx script.

The gaps in the assembly are recorded in GFF format.
